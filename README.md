# Blizzard Redesign (Landing Page)

![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/guidominguesdev/codeboost-consuming-pokeapi.svg)

> The project is still in development, and the upcoming updates will focus on completing the responsive layout of the website.

## Adjustments and improvements

This is a [CodeBoost](https://codeboost.com.br/) course project that has been improved and adjusted from the original version presented in the course. The changes include:

- Illustrations in `.svg` format were loaded inline.
- Added to the project: [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/).
- The images were loaded in a different folder from the illustrations.
- A [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) plugin was added to optimize all `.svg`, `.jpg`, `.png` and `.gif` files.
- The files were separated into distinct folders for Development and Distribution.
- All `.scss` files are now organized into subfolders.
- New SASS variables and mixins were created to avoid code repetition.
- Applied the `@use` and `@forward` techniques in SASS instead of `@import`.
- The `.js` files were reorganized into separate directories.
- Almost all components and assets were readjusted to be faithful to the Figma layout.
- Improved responsiveness. Previously, it was optimized only for resolutions below 1440px.
- Adjusted `.slide-thumbnail` component behavior to keep it anchored to the left side of the `.container`.
